# Step I Must

This game is a Python-based fan recreation of an excellent puzzle game called N Step Steve (found [here](https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-1) and [here](https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-2)). It was built entirely from scratch in Python for educational and personal use only.
