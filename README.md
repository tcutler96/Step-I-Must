This game is a Python-based fan recreation of an excellent 2D Sokoban-style puzzle game called N Step Steve (found [here](https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-1) and [here](https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-2)).

It aims to replicate the mechanics and feel of the original while exploring how such a system could be implemented from scratch.

You control one or more slimes that must collect keys, gems, and cheeses to unlock the way forward â€” one step at a time.

The game features 

Built with Python 3.13.5, PyGame (for window, input, and audio control), and OpenGL (GLSL shaders for rendering effects)
