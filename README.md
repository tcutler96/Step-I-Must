# Step I Must

This game is a Python-based fan recreation of an excellent puzzle game called N Step Steve (found [here](https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-1) and [here](https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-2)). It was built entirely from scratch in Python for educational and personal use only.

## About the Game

**Step I Must** is a 2D Sokoban-style puzzle game where each move counts.  
You control one (or more) slimes who can only take a limited number of steps.  
Each level challenges you to plan your moves carefully to reach the goal.
