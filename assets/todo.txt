*** audio ***
- add remaining sound files


*** sprites ***
- add remaining sprites (flags, barriers, player spawner?)
- neaten the cursor sprite up a bit
- rework scrollbar images to better fit the theme, antialias the edges
- main menu title sprite
- add better silhouette version of fraction sprite


*** shaders ***
- look into loop hero noise transition shader


*** utility ***
- add animation to 'other' images such as cell marker
- need to rework game transition effect (player bump and pixealte shader)
- clicking window 'x' does not close window while mid transition, we can't start a new transition mid transition
- separate game back into more distinct display layers again that can be controlled individually, only add this as needed
- in assets, save copies of images that have had their alpha set, so that future calls just grab the image instead of having to re set it ({image: alpha[0-255]: surface})
- need to do a full game run through to test all the levels work as intended
- track collectables and their locations when we save a level, so we know max counts for map tracker, and can tell which collectables are left (to guide player in right direction with cryptid tracker)
-- no longer need to work out collectable max counts in map tracker, just pull game game data instead
-- add way to loop over all levels and resave them, in order to fix any wrong data concerning teleporters or collectables etc.


*** game bugs ***
- picking up a collectable prevents animations from finishing, need to continue to resolve level loop
- looped animations arent being stopped when we transision to another level
- undo/ redo does not save game data (when we change levels) or update player location on map, it should also get any players out of sleeping state
- bumping a player into the wall should wake it up from sleeping
- when map is opened during a cutscene, we need to reset the sprite timers (ie have players and teleporters show first)
- leaving a level while stood on a sign plays the close text sound when we are in the new level, instead of straight away
- setting certain cells in the level editor spams the sound effect (any player on a flag, any cell on a barrier)
- remove player respawn sprite when that flag is deleted when a player is turned to stone on top of it
- playing a level from the level editor and then opening the game menu shows button as 'main menu' but it actually takes you back to the level editor, can we change the button text easily? from assets update_menu perhaps?
- sliding on ice into a barrier that has ice behind it causes the game to crash


*** level crashes ***
- (-3, -12): object conflict on ice
- (-3, -13): sliding into a wall trigger bump a bunch of times
- (-3, -14): rocks dont behave properly when they meet in the middle
- (-5, -6): sliding into a barrier crashes game
- (-2, -7): conveying a chain of flags into edge of level doesnt move the flags but it does push the player when it shoudnt


*** game features ***
- add special cutscenes when the last of a respective collectable if obtained, add all collectables spiralling around the player
- have collectable cutscenes increase number of collectables spiralling around the player as they are collected
- draw everything to the screen whether the map or menu is open or not, so that can see them when the pixelate shader is applied
- pressing play instead goes to a select save menu (choose from 3 saves), which displays progression percentage in menu button, can reset game data from here as well (no need to new game button on main menu then)
- when we first reach the second world, have the map automatically open and switch over at the end of the cutscene
- add slight pause before continually undoing/ redoing, as we sometimes acidentally undo/ redo more then we mean to (similar to movement pause)
- need to add a gem resetter tile that resets level and collected gem in that level (remove specific gem from game collectable data...), (4, -6)(4, 13), (5, -6)(10, 1), manually add data to game data
-- when we step on a gem reseter tile, look up in data which gem to reset, then remove that gem from collected collectables, map collection, and add back to cached levels
- add a more cryptic hint to level (-6, -6) that tells the player that portals can be activated by stepping in bwtween two barriers
- add mini maze to level (-1, -17) which leads to cryptid tracker (add overlay to map which shows which cryptids are remaining and sign explaining this) and then final cheese collectable, add a reciever teleporter to this room
- add something to level (-3, -17) instead of the light puzzle

*** level ideas ***
- add level with numerical code written with barriers that tells the secret to beating the level, we need to something in a particular order?
- add a portal (unlocked when we have all but one of the silvers gems in the first world) that takes us to level (-1, 1) (add a teleporter here) which has a sign that gives a hint as to getting the last gem
-- the signs says something along the lines of 'join the top left queue to fill in the gap in the map in the first level'
-- this requires the player to go back to the first level in the first world and move into the empty gap in the map when it is overlayed onto the level (also the top left of the turorial keys)
-- this triggers a portal to level (-1, 0) which contains more puzzles the player must navigate
-- add the last collectable to the top left of the spawn level that is unreachable until we come back from this new secret level into the spawn level
- add level that starts very pixelated (very hard to tell what anything is) but get clearer/ less pixelated as the player moves towards some secret spot in the level
