# add glow effect to hud layer
# add animation to 'other' images such as cell marker
# look into loop hero noise transition shader...
# reset asset animation counter when we return to main menu?
# neaten the cursor sprite up a bit
# rework scrollbar images to better fit the theme, antialias the edges?
# starting the game in debug mode does not set steps correctly...
# middle clicking a wall in the level editor crashes the game...
# if we draw text one letter at a time (with a short delay), centred on a position, might make a cool way of displaying speech text...
# rescale map elements and have them fade in and out when map opened and closed...
# add level with numerical code written with barriers that tells the secret to beating the level...
# add secret where opening a fully explored map on a particular level reveals a secret, the map tiles point towards something...
# add secret with a hint on a sign that says 'fill in the gap on the map in the first level' or something a bit more cryptic, which requires the player to go back to the first level in the first world,
# and move such that they are in the empty gap on the map when it is overlayed onto the level, this triggers a portal to level (-1, 0) for a secret (maybe add cheeses to world 1?)...
# add another clue to this along the lines of 'join the top-left queue', indicating to go to the position of the letter 'q' and top left arrow on a keyboard...
# add a portal next to the sign that gives the original hint that takes us to level (-1, 1)...
# and add a collectable to the top left of the spawn level that is unreachable until we come back from this new secret level into the spawn spawn...
# add room that starts very pixelated (very hard to tell what anything is) but get clearer/ less pixelated as the player moves towards some secret spot in the level...
# add effect the end of the first game, as the player moves forward, the level gets more and more pixelated until they are standing on the teleporter to take them to the second game...
# have collectable text move upwards on the screen and dont limit player movement...
# spawning ontop of a collectable (seting respawn while in debug mode and so not collecting collectable) breaks the level loading, steps arent set properly...
# loading game in debug mode crashes when you try to take a step...
# clicking window x does not close window while mid transition...
# draw sign text as pixelated until it can be decoded?
# separate level into distinct display layers that can be controlled individually (level, player, text?)
# restarting level or quitting game while map is switching breaks it...
# in the game, always draw things to the screen whether the map or menu is open, so that can see them when the level is blurred...
# have game blur when the map opens take ~30 frames/ 0.5 seconds
# add main menu title sprite, remove title from menu data and then just draw sprite from main menu or integrate into menu class...
# add multiple save files, just need to have multiple data jsons that we can switch between...
# pressing play instead goes to a select save menu, which displays progression percentage in menu button...
# add sound for quitting the game...
# have states automatically play music that has been assigned to them (in assets?)...
# we play the teleport sound if we close the map by clicking on the the level we are currently in...
# have map switch while in cutscene for the second world...
# add reflection shader to ice...
# add ability when playing a sound to stop all other instances of that sound...
# spearate menu display layer into title and everything else, then we can apply a shader to the menu title...
# quickly unblur splash screen elements as they appear...
# when a player exits a level while on fast movement, we can see them bump back in before the transition comes in, add longer bum?
# only play spike sound effect if alive player on top of a spike, not a dead one...
# picking up a collectable prevents animations from finishing...
# add message when a collectable is got that unlocks a lock somewhere, say where...
# dont play sign close sound when we teleport off a sign...
# undo/ redo does not save game data...
# add all game controls (move, menu, undo, redo) to map screen?
# add better silhouette version of fraction sprite and swap to normal sprite when all collectables of a type is collected...
# we need to save game data as soon as teleport data is updated...
# add afk timer to game the changes player state to sleeping after no action taken for a while...
# add rainbow colour effect to player when they collect a collectable and have collectable swirl around the player...
# when map is opened during a cutscene, we need to reset the sprite timers (ie have players and teleporters show first)...
# add sound for triggering portals/ cryptids...
# player player move sound when we move out of a level...
# merge transition display layer into ui layer, just make sure we always draw it last...
# in assets, save copies of images that have had their alpha set, so that future calls just grab the image instead of having to reset it ({image: alpha[0-255]: {}})...
# leaving a level while stood on a sign plays the close text sound when we are in the new level, instead of straight away...
# remove player respawn sprite when that flag is deleted when a player is turned to stone on top of it...
# undo/ redo should get player out of sleeping state
# only draw alive players on the player display layer...
# setting certain cells in the level editor spams the sound effect: any player on a flag, any cell on a barrier...
# add slight pause before continually undoing/ redoing, as we sometimes acidentally undo/ redo more then we mean to...
# we could add more display layers back in, as hooleys crash was not caused by too manu uniforms...
# add way in game to reset game data so that the only menu option is new game, add to develop menu...
# we need to manually save game data when teleporters are updated, maybe add a way to just save certain bits of data (ie game, teleporters)...
playing a level from the level editor and then opening the game menu shows button as 'main menu' but it actually takes you back to the level editor, can we change the button text easily?
